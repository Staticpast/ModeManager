## Developer API

ModeManager provides an API for other plugins to interact with its functionality. To use the API, you need to get the API instance from the services manager:

```java
// Get the API from the services manager
RegisteredServiceProvider<ModeManagerAPI> provider = 
    Bukkit.getServicesManager().getRegistration(ModeManagerAPI.class);
    
if (provider != null) {
    ModeManagerAPI api = provider.getProvider();
    
    // Now you can use the API methods
    if (api.isPluginEnabled()) {
        // Check a player's mode
        GameMode mode = api.getPlayerMode(player);
        
        // Change a player's mode
        api.changePlayerMode(player, GameMode.CREATIVE, "API call from MyPlugin");
        
        // Check if a block was placed in creative mode
        boolean isCreative = api.isCreativeBlock(location);
        
        // Get a player's mode history
        List<ModeChangeRecord> history = api.getPlayerModeHistory(player);
    }
}
```
